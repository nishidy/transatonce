#Purpose
You can translate many words in a textbox at once through among choices, alc, goo and longman.
The result of each word's translation will follow to show as it calls back function for it.
The word will be blinked at top right corner each time the entry is retrieved.  
This application is running on Google App Engine.  <http://transatonce.appspot.com>  
Actually, it would be very fast to get the result if you run this script on GAE launcher locally.

#Requirement
Need Beautifulsoup and jQuery.
